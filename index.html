                    I enjoy reading a good book by one of my fav authors such as HP Lovecraft, Douglas Adams, HG wells and so on. My hobbies are cooking, baking, going for long walks from time to time and spending time with my loved ones. Things I don’t like are people who are not punctual and not responsible.

I had an older brother growing up which was not as fun as some people might think it is, we fought a lot as kids and always competing with each other. But having an older brother only helped me gain a more mature perspective towards the world as he’d always talk to me and teach me about new things. I clearly remember the time when my bother came back from school and told me about what he learned today, my mind was absolutely blown when he he told me how earth revolves around the sun. Which may seem quite silly thinking I used to believe moon and the sun were the same entity in space and sun was just not on fire for a few hours of the day and that’s how we got nights. But it made such an impression on me and made me extremely curious about discovering more about space.

                    along with some entry level C programming. So I had a pretty good base in both business world and IT.

                  ools used for business process analysis.I was lucky enough to have a pretty in depth learning
                  experience about both the business world and IT world as I strongly
                  believe the both the business and IT can benefit so much from each other, if we implement IT in business correctly it can change everything about it and make it more efficient and better and same goes for IT. Understanding value of them both sets me up for a pretty good knowledge about them, and how we can integrate them together.

                  By being in a place where everything was always changing and pivoting, it made me great at adapting to new things much more quickly and flexible to change.
Interacting with customers was my major role there, and dealing with various customers with different and niche needs. I learnt how to handle customers, give status updates and presentation.
Translating user requirements into what the IT team can understand and work on. And translating the technical jargon to what the customer and other stakeholders can understand.
What I consider one of the most valuable learning I got from working there was how to hand an angry customer. I consider it one my most valuable learning because through it I learned how to have patience while dealing with difficult customers, work through the problem the customer is facing or why are they dissatisfied and how we as a team can deliver the product that meets customers expectation.
 Also how to set the customers expectations to be realistic in the first place.

                    I consider being a good listener as my biggest strength. I like to listen to people, listening and understanding what they have to say without being bias or forming opinions without properly understanding them. Being a good listener helped me through the years, having to deal with various customers and bosses I had over the years.
Another thing about me that I consider as my strength is being persistent and not giving up because the solution is always right around the corner and we won’t get to it if we give up, only option is to keep working through the problem.

                      What I consider to be my weakness is being too much of a perfectionist, almost never being satisfied with anything. Feeling there’s always room to improve. Also believing If you want something done right you have to do it yourself which makes me very bad at delegating work and end up taking the blunt of the work, which I can’t possibly work through alone and as they say team work makes the dream work.
                      But over the years I have learned the art of delegation, seeing through people and gauging what they’re capable of doing and delivering, delegating work accordingly to get desired results from them.

                There are a couple of important skills and traits that make me an ideal
                candidate for the position of business analyst and what will make me a p
                erfect fit in your organisation. Being an IT I learned a plenty of programming
                languages such as C,C++,HTML,JAVA and various frameworks such as asp.net, ruby on rails. But also having knowledge of SQL and python for data analysis.

                  I’m always curious and ready to learn new things as they come.

So I believe its very important in life to keep on learning new things and experimenting with new ideas.</p>

                    My hobbies range from sitting at home and watching a good tv show to going to a pool for swim.</p>

                    <p class="lead">
In particular I really enjoy reading a book, specifically sci-fi novels, they really show the extent of imagination and as they say if  you can imagine it you can probably achieve it. For example space travel was part of the sci-fi novels way before NASA sent astronauts to space, one can even argue reading books about distant worlds and possibilities only inspired the scientist to achieve it.</p>
<p class="lead">
Being a developer it should come as no surprise that I am a huge coffee snob, from grinding my own coffee beans and brewing them is an important part of my day to day and I could have a lengthy conversation about just coffee. Some other things I could have a lengthy conversation about is Tv shows and movies (every movie created by Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan is a masterpiece).

    For my schooling I went to Sacred heart school, which was renewed for its good teachers and great in supporting students to excel in their education. I was fortunate enough to have a  programming class in my school only helping me get exposure into programming at an early age and getting me interested in pursuing it at higher level.

                        For graduation I went to IK Gujral technical university where I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to grow as a person and truly find myself and what I wanna be. Most important thing I learned during my graduation is definitely how much they emphasised on presentations and having presentation every 3 weeks for the term of my entire graduation helped me gain confidence for public speaking.
